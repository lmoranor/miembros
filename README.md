ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning for a Club's Member Database

In this project, I performed data cleaning on a Club's member database using MySQL. The dataset featured information on the members such as occupation, home adress, phone numbers. The data presented several issues, including:

Duplicate records

Extra spaces in text fields

Entries with typos

Incorrect data types

Inconsistent date formats

The goal was to standardize and prepare the data for future analysis and reporting.

The original database is 'club.csv' and the cleaned one is 'limp_final.csv'
